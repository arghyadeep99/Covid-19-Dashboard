<h2>Motivation:</h2> 

I always wished to create dashboard from simple data visualizations that we do as a machine learning practioner. While this repository doesn't contain any machine learning visualization, this is simply visualzing the data available from John Hopkins University repository. The dashboard has been developed using Plotly, Jupyter Notebook and deployed on Heroku using Voila.

### Goals of this project:

* [x] Learn more data visualization techniques. 
* [x] Learn about deploying Jupyter Notebook to web using Voila as a stand-alone web application.
* [x] Make the website extract data dynamically each time the website is visited.
* [x] Cut out boredom during this quarantine phase.

### Showstoppers:

* [ ] Unable to remove the metadata that is being printed at the end of the website.
* [ ] The website runs all cells of the Jupyter Notebook each time the website is visited (includes refreshing). This slows down the loading time, considering projects involving large number of cells or code.
* [ ] The graphs take a bit of time to load even after the website is shown as loaded. The graphs need an additional time to display. 

### Future scope of this project:

* [ ] Add more, more and more visualizations! Looking forward to PRs and issues being raised for adding more interactive and unique visualizations.  
* [ ] Improve the loading time of the website. 

### Tech Stack of this Project:

* Backend: Python3
* Dependencies: Voila, Heroku
* Libraries: Available in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/arghyadeep99/Covid-19-Dashboard/blob/master/requirements.txt).


#### This project still has scope of development, so you can also contribute to this Project as follows:
* [Fork](https://github.com/arghyadeep99/Covid-19-Dashboard) this Repository.
* Clone your Fork on a different branch:
	* `git clone -b <name-of-branch> https://github.com/arghyadeep99/Covid-19-Dashboard.git`
* After adding any feature:
	* Goto your fork and create a pull request.
	* I will test your modifications and merge changes.

This project was done `in my quarantine time under Lockdown.`
